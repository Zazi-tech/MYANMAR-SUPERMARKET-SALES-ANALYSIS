# MYANMAR-SUPERMARKET-SALES-ANALYSIS

**Executive Summary**

This report presents a structured analysis of sales data from a three-branch supermarket chain in Myanmar. The objective is to evaluate overall sales performance, understand customer behaviour, identify high- and low-performing product lines, and reveal patterns across time, customer types, and payment methods.
Findings indicate strong overall revenue, high adoption of digital payments, and consistently strong performance in product lines such as Electronics, Food & Beverages, and Sports & Travel. Member customers tend to spend slightly more per transaction, and Branch A leads in sales volume. The insights provided will support strategic decisions aimed at increasing profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and improving operational efficiency.
